Great! I've successfully implemented an MCP server based on the examples from the Python SDK. Here's a summary of what I've created:

1. **Directory Structure:**

- Created `mcp_server` directory
- Created Python package structure with `__init__.py` and `__main__.py` files

2. **Server Implementation:**

- Created `server.py` with a FastMCP server implementation
- Implemented a `run_codex` tool that accepts repository, branch (optional), folder (optional), and request parameters
- Included functionality to clone the repository, checkout a branch if specified, and navigate to a specific folder if provided
- Added a mock implementation for Codex execution (to be replaced with actual Codex integration)

3. **Package Configuration:**

- Created `pyproject.toml` with dependencies and package metadata
- Created `README.md` with documentation on how to use the MCP server

4. **Verified Installation:**

- Installed the package in development mode
- Verified successful import

This implementation:

- Takes a repository URL, optional branch, optional folder, and required request as inputs
- Clones the repository to a temporary directory
- Checks out the specified branch if provided
- Navigates to the specified folder within the repository if provided
- Runs a mock Codex implementation (which would be replaced with the actual Codex integration)
- Returns the results

To run the server, you can use:
```python
python -m mcp_server  # For stdio transport (default)
```
or
```python
python -m mcp_server --transport sse --port 8000  # For SSE transport on port 8000
```

The server exposes a tool called run_codex that can be called from an MCP client with the required parameters.
